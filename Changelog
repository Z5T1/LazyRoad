Version 0.8.2

    Fixed bug #22

Version 0.8.1

    Fixed /lt and /lb not working correctly 

Version 0.8.0 Big update :D

    New Feature: LazyMiner - For the people who want to get blocks that making a road replaces
        Commands
            /lazyminer : Enables or Disables LM.
            /lazyminer ids : Displays the Ids that LM mines.
            /lazyminer addid <BlockID> : Adds an id to that list.
            /lazyminer removeid <BlockID> : Removes an id from that list.
            /lazyminer store : Places your mined blocks in the chest you're looking at. 
        Can add and remove new BlockIds for LM to save.
        Can view currently set Ids LM checks for
        Has permission node default op.
        If the block's mined by LM, LR will not put that block in the undo.
        Mined blocks, Checked Ids, and if LM is enabled is saved between sessions, so no worrying about server restarts and disconnects.
            /reload s of the server may mess it up though. I'll fix this in 0.8.1. 
    New Permissions
        lazyroad.build : Still gives full access to LR and now gives permission for LazyMiner features too
        lazyroad.user : Gives access to all the commands but not the roads or pillars, which bring me to the next 2 permissions.
        lazyroad.road.<RoadName> : Gives access to just the road named in RoadName so permission for the 'Basic' road it would be lazyroad.road.basic
        lazyroad.pillar.<PillarName> : Same as the road permission except for pillars not roads
        So now you can limit your users to specific road and pillar types without removing them from the folders.
        lazyroad.lazyminer : Gives permission to use the LazyMiner features 
    Aliases for commands
        /lr = /road
        /lt = /tunnel
        /lb = /bridge
        /lm = /lazyminer

    Updated the blocks that Pillars and Walking ignore
        Pillars additionally will replace lily pads, snow, ice, vines, and nether wart
        Walking additionally ignores lily pads, vines and nether wart 
    Added the ability to force the tunnel/bridge to go up or down.
        You can do it while placing /road but it can trap you when going up.
        To use when placing road you can do /[road|tunnel|bridge] [up|down|normal]
        "normal" return the system to placing with out the forced direction. 
    Removed the Update Advertiser.
