About
======

This is my fork of the LazyRoad plugin. It is intended primarily for bug fixes, but also adds a few new features as well.


LazyRoad
======

Very simple plugin that allows you to quickly build roads, bridges, tunnels and more. Just type a command and then walk, the road will create itself as you walk

Compilation
-----------

I do not use maven to handle dependencies. I've kept the maven files for people who wish to continue using maven, however I will not be updating maven settings. Compile this however you'd like, it shouldn't be that complicated.
